def cv_multi_score(model, predictors, target, scoring, folds):
    """
    Calculate cross-validation scores for a given model.

    Parameters:
    model (sklearn.base.BaseEstimator): The model to evaluate.
    predictors (pandas.DataFrame or numpy.array): The predictor variables.
    target (pandas.Series or numpy.array): The target variable.
    scoring (str, callable, list/tuple, dict or None): A single string scorer 
        callable or a list/tuple of single scorer callables or a dict object 
        with keys being the scorer names and values the scorer callables.
    folds (int or cross-validation generator): The number of folds in K-fold 
        cross validation, or a cross-validation generator.

    Returns:
    scores (dict): A dictionary of the mean and standard deviation of the 
        test scores for each scorer.
